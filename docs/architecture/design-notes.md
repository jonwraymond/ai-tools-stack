# Design Notes Index

This page aggregates the per‑repo **Design Notes** pages that document tradeoffs
and error semantics for each component. Use these when you want to understand
why a design decision was made or how to handle specific failure modes.

## When to read these

- You’re debugging failure modes or error propagation.
- You want to compare tradeoffs (latency vs safety, flexibility vs simplicity).
- You’re deciding where to plug in a custom implementation.
